    "## 1. Introduction and Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Background\n",
    "The Friis Free Space Propagation Model is a fundamental tool in wireless communications for predicting the received power of a signal transmitted over a line-of-sight (LOS) path in free space. It accounts for factors such as transmitted power, antenna gains, frequency, and distance between transmitter and receiver. This model assumes an ideal environment with no obstacles, reflections, or atmospheric effects, making it a baseline for understanding signal propagation in real-world systems like Wi-Fi, satellite communications, and cellular networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Theoretical Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Friis Transmission Equation calculates the received power (P_r) as a function of transmitted power (P_t), antenna gains (G_t, G_r), wavelength (λ), and distance (d):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Expression:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "P_r = P_t * (G_t * G_r * λ^2) / (4πd)^2\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- P_r: Received power (W)\n",
    "- P_t: Transmitted power (W)\n",
    "- G_t: Transmitter antenna gain (dimensionless)\n",
    "- G_r: Receiver antenna gain (dimensionless)\n",
    "- λ: Wavelength (m), where λ = c / f, c = 3 × 10^8 m/s, f = frequency (Hz)\n",
    "- d: Distance between transmitter and receiver (m)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
    "- **Inverse Square Law:** Received power decreases with the square of the distance (1/d^2).\n",
    "- **Frequency Dependence:** Higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) result in lower received power.\n",
    "- **Antenna Gains:** Higher gains increase received power.\n",
    "- **Free Space Assumption:** Valid only for LOS paths with no obstructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Power in dBm:** To express power in decibels-milliwatts (dBm), convert watts to milliwatts and apply the logarithmic scale:\n",
    "```\n",
    "P_r (dBm) = 10 * log10(P_r * 1000)\n",
    "```"
